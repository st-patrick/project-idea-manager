No, better yet identify common subgroups when looking for a tag: if it’s a tag with like 30 notes it will then display suggestions within those 30 notes’ tags, so basically narrow the scope of the note count to the currently displayed notes\nAnd then basically that can be used to determine “sharpness” of a note, whether it’s easily findable with a sub-tag click-through like that\n\n\nshow connectivity of tags, basically by counting how many notes have any pair of tags in them\n\n#pills #dev replace stupid search save button mechanic with a simple save button on top incl feedback\n\n#pills #dev this would be a good opportunity to convert it into a daily overview of \"characters written\", in the sense that I can go through it chronologically, independent if individual notes #priority #fun\n\n#pills #dev need more backups / data redundancy, especially when so sensitive. \n\nMetadata to count tags etc.. #dev #pills\n\n#pills #dev #landingpage \"fuck notion, fuck your shopping list and fuck the goddamn motherfuckin google calendar\" \"your data is my bitch (you heard me)\"\n\n#pills #dev allow (NLP) to suggest tags in a floating popup or something. Most used tags, current date, ...\n\nView buttons to trigger calendar, todo view #pills #dev\n\nCut short xtra long thoughts like basic checklists #dev #pills\n\nShow count for tags and suggest splitting them up into more sensible units #dev #pills\n\nAnd of course combine #dev and #pills \n\n+ entering that pound isn't super fun with the double keyboard switch... would be easier if it was right here like a floating \"pill button\"\n                 \n\nSame with save, should be fixed and always visible #pills ... better yet a sexy ass button\n\nAnd also can we fix that safari always zooms into the text field? Although it's nice but... not very app-like #dev   \n\n#pills #dev \n\nWhen I search for a tag, that tag doesn't need to show in the texts ... like when using as a calendar, I don't need to see the hashtah name EVERYWHERE\n\nagain another note missing, the one with the ordering of how creative things I do are... #bug #pills #dev\n\n\n#pills #dev move the add new thing to top so I don't have to scroll al the time\n\n#pills #dev for combining Tag searches: press enter to add tag (which turns it into colored thing) press enter again to search\n\n#pills #dev\n\nI would say some constraints are that objects are short, like in google keep or shorter.\n\nanything that comes close to a \"document\" doesn't fit\n\nWhen adding a new element while view is filtered, automatically add those words / tags to the new element.\n\nLike when I'm filtering by shopping list, any new element automatically gets tag shopping list\n\n#dev #pills\n\nCollect metadata that has no entropy, needs no user #dev #pills\n\nTime spend\nDate created\nAny time changed\n...\n\n#bug #dev #pills when I am in a filtered view and add a new thought, it doesn't get saved or better, it gets deleted. Don't know how to recreate it but it definitely happened. Search term \"basic\" added a thought, then deleted some of the search and it was gone\n\nIt's when using the show all button instead of deleting search field#pills #dev make the top field the natural starting point for a new note as is intuitive (instead of having to click on the icon ... use icon for something else... menu or idk)\n\ndon't show any notes when first opening and only allow adding. \"dump mode\" basically that will only send the new note. But then I'd need a real backend. unless I keep an emptier document that only contains most recent notes\n\n#pills #dev count how often notes got into view and let users see notes they definitely haven't seen in a long time\n\n#pills #dev simple button that turns view into a \"doneable\" view with checkboxes. In that view, checked items are hidden or sent to bottom and unchecked ones on top. Outside the view not\n\n#pills #fundev #feature button \"doable\" turns everything into a off checkable list with dones showing at bottom or hidden\n\n#pills #business so basically I need to educate users to use note taking like me (like Netflix conditioned folks to bingewatch) OR make it more compatible with the prevalent school of thought (project, todo, calendar, reminders, people)\n\nwhen I save, it shouldn't remove the filter but stay in the same view #bug #pills\n\n#pills #marketing \"@google your daddy abandoned you and that's why your software sucks\"\n\n#pills #marketing \"yo @google, your calendar so buggy I could take it for a ride in the beach\"\n\n#pills #business deluxe pricing for zero knowledge account \"are you a goddam criminal? We got you. Zero knowledge \"\n\nAlso the most relevant ones should be on top... either by how often I edit them or pinned like google keep #pills\n\n\n\nbe able to select those \"edges\" = all notes that have both tags\n\nmaybe if possible even \"faces\" = all notes that contain three tags\n\nAlso, if I want to really go on a dumping spree, I don't want to be adding a hashtag after everything\n\nRather, like in hwd, I just want to write a bunch of stuff and then them being there #pills #ux\n\nfeatures to find notes that are not tagged, that have singular tags, etc... basically to make sure notes can be found when needed\n\nalthoug... I mean everything that has no tag is basically part of dump... everything that is never searched for is dump\n\nanother bug in pills:: I looked up \"hwd::\", then edited that note, then created a new note, clicked on \"show all\", created a new note, pasted content, saved and when I looked for \"hwd:: again, it was all gone\"\n\neverything that is never edited and so on...\n\nbasically any thought would get something like a \"pagerank\", the more in demand it is\n\npills:: go back to its original idea of being like aspex and having #shop and #calendar #dream #goal trigger unique views ... so really it's more like a self-categorizing everything dump... using timestamps to create timeline views.... \n\nGosh that sounds over complicated and over engineered\n\njust basic types of documents on custom domains etc...\nlike my todo and fitness app\n\nyou have a url, it's there, done.\n\nbasically how whatsapp improved messengers with zero overhead, improve note taking just like that. Minimal\n\nYou have basic templates to choose from, like the todo thing\nlike the gym tracking accordion\n\n\nThe upside to this #pills thing is that I can easily implement garbage collection by burying notes I never look at deeper and deeper in another document that doesn't get loaded....\n\nBut that will still be searched in... eventually?\n\nHmm... idk but garbage collection is a good word\n\nFind duplicates\nSuggest merging similar ones",

Like a radius search to start study groups.\nand kinda like \"meetups\" parties to get to know people in general from similar fields to then possibly start a group with\nBut I guess online works too, like I am doing now\n\na lot of things that essentially teach the same shit are called differently with fancy name \"AB-12345423124 introduction to the historical importance of dices and game tokens\"\n\nthings that are not usual with every professor but would probably improve education:\n+ project based learning\n+ showing relevant news for that course\n\noptions for materials:\n+ only read / watch / listen\n+ read / watch / listen and take notes\n+ read + work on assignments\n+ read but only work on certain assignments\n\nrate lessons and assignments by fun so you know which to do when, which need you to chew through them and which are good anytime\n\nallow commercial teachers (udemy masterclass etc.) to reference paid content, even so much as paid articles.\nallow external people to say where their content fits in in order to promote it.

Exams could also help compare quality of courses, the more exams from other courses students can easily take, the higher the quality of the course\n+ not easily navigated\n+ don't let you mark parts as completed (which makes random browsing / pick and choose hard. It's more fun to learn what you feel like and know where you have already been)\n\nTODO what don't I like about other big education providers?\n+ KhanAcademy\n+ Udemy\n+ edX\n+ coursera\n+ linkedin learning\n+ moodle\n>>\n+ does not allow for individual differences, does not allow to find same content explained by another source\n+ everything from same team of professors. stiff, bad, often the professors themselves don't know the teaching material\n+ \n\nAllow unstructured mind map birds eye view to let people pick what they want to do first or learn first and be guided by passion.
